"""Design-kind wrappers for the five compiled/dynamic languages.

The design protocol (see python_harness._invoke_design /
OpenOJJavaHarness.invokeDesign) is: a case carries `actions` (method
names, or {"call", "repeat"} for randomized methods) and `params` (an
argument list per action; params[0] builds the instance). Each action's
decoded result is recorded; a {"$prev"} argument pipes the previous
raw result into the next call; a randomized action reports a frequency
table over its repeated results.

That replay loop lives in the *generated wrapper* for these languages,
written per problem from the invocation's method table. The case
travels as one tagged stream (executors/typed.py): actions as a tagged
string array (or object rows for randomized calls), then params rows,
each a tagged array whose elements are tagged values; the wrapper
decodes with the generic reader, converts per-parameter via the
invocation's codecs when a method needs a typed value (python3/js/ts
consume the raw values directly), and emits the recorded outputs as a
JSON array on the result channel.

A per-language shim object (`OjDesign`) provides decode-by-codec where
the language needs typed values (cpp/go/rust); python-style languages
pass raw values through, mirroring the python harness.
